    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>You're excited to launch a new website but want a reference of what the old site looked like. We can make a copy of most sites in 30 minutes or less. No sweat.</p>
    <p>Or maybe your seldom updated website is slow. Your CMS is too old, complicated, costly and results in occasional downtime. Maybe you're just tired of getting all that comment spam.</p>
    <p>Website Dumper will give you a perfect static version of your existing website!</p>

<div class="span3">
    <h3>How?</h3>
    <p>Enter your URL and e-mail, and click Dump! Upon completing the payment page we will copy all publicly accessible pages that are linked to within your site. After we've made a copy of your pages and necessary assets (like images, etc.), they will be deployed to our <a href="http://www.supersimple.co">SuperSimple static site hosting</a> platform where all assets are pushed to the Akamai CDN for speedy delivery and unmatched availability.</p>
</div>
<div class="span3">
    <h3>Price?</h3>
    <p>The price is $150. This includes the archive process and hosting for a full year (you are free to switch hosts at any time). If needed, someone on our team will personally help you change DNS settings and replace your contact form so it keeps working. The only additional charges will be an annual hosting fee of $60 beginning a year after the dump.</p>

    <h3>What else?</h3>
     <p>It is important to note that this process will make your site "static" and will have no Content Management System login or admin interface.</p>
    <p>If you need to access the site HTML files and assets you may access them via your Dropbox account. Any changes to files you make in your Dropbox will be automatically reflected on your website.</p>
    <p>This archive can be a replacement, the basis for a new website, or simply a copy to live on forever.</p>
